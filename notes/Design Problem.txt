The program must have a command line version and a gui version


COMMAND LINE:
The program must be able to the following in that exact order:

 - Create a github repo
   if the user supplies a name, that will be used
   if the user does not supply a name, then the name of the current directory will be used (after it has been made all lowercase and all spaces replaced with '_'
   if the user does not want to create a remote repository, he must have that option

 - have the option to pass in a directory in which the the local repository will be set.
   If the user does not pass in an argument, then it will default to the current directory

 - create a venv, virtual_env or pipenv, if the user supplies the corresponding flag
   a venv.bat and venv.sh scripts must be added in the root directory as well to allow easy access to the venv

 - create the following directories if the user supplies the corresponding flags:
	+ docs
	+ logs
	+ notes
	+ src
	+ tests

 - create the following files if the user supplies the corresponding flags:
	+ requirements.txt

 - get a .gitignore file from github if the user supplies the corresponding flag and argument

 - do the following commands to initialise the local repo:
	echo "# {file name}" >> README.md
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/{username}/{repository}.git
	git push -u origin master

 - the program must allow a config file to be passed in



GUI:
 - the program must display the following fields:
	+ location of local repo
	+ github repo name (automatically set this to directory name of local repo, all lowercase, spaces replaced with '_')
	  the user then has the choice to change it if he wishes
	+ checkboxes: select which venv they want, including None
	+ checkboxes for the following folders and files:
		+ docs
		+ logs
		+ notes
		+ src
		+ tests
		+ requirements.txt
	+ combobox: which gitignore template file user wants, if any
	  this must be downloaded from github at start of program

 - program must have config file "defaults.ini" which loads the default options for all fields

 - program must then create all expected files and folders
